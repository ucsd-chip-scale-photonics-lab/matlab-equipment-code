function [measured_V, measured_I, measured_P] = key_do_V_sweep(...
    key, v_min, v_max, v_step, v_comp, i_comp, settle_time, function_handle)
% Do a voltage sweep with the specified parameters
    % - key: keithley VISA object (see key_start())
    % - v_min: (V)  minimum voltage of sweep
    % - v_max: (V) maximum voltage of sweep
    % - v_step: (V) voltage step of sweep
    % - i_comp: (mA) compliance current of voltage source throughout experiment
    % - settle_time: time (in seconds) to pause after each voltage point on the
    %       sweep prior to taking any further actions
    % - function_handle: function to be executed at each voltage point in the
    %       sweep (after settle time). This argument is meant to provide a way
    %       to perform ANY measurement you'd like at each voltage step. This
    %       function will not be called with any arguments, and the return
    %       value(s) will not be accessible.
% This allows a single voltage sweep function to be used for many types of
    % experiments, and allows swapping out optical equipment with different
    % interfaces in a modular way.

% However, it also means the function handle you pass has to handle
    % everything in a self-contained way, including saving the output to a data
    % structure etc. This is best accomplished simply by configuring the
    % function to store its results in global variables

% Returns:
    % - measured_V: vector of actual voltages measured at each sample (V)
    % - measured_I: vector of actual current measured at each sample (mA)
    % - measured_V: vector of actual power measured at each sample (mW)
